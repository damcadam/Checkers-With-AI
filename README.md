**Purpose:** Project for Data and Program Stuctures (CIS 300)  
**Language:** C# 

## Description
This project is an implementation of Checkers that lets users play against an AI. The AI utilizes a game tree. It uses a negamax algorithm to determine the best move in the game tree. The program uses Alpha-beta pruning to reduce the number of nodes the negamax algorithm needs to evaluate in the tree. Players can play against the computer on difficulty levels ranging from 1 to 12. The level corresponds to the height of the game tree the AI uses to generate its next move.
